## Sports Teams App


### We created this app as a way for parent's to reserve a date to bring snack for their child's little league game. 

##### Everyone deserves a delicious snack after a playing hard!

* To use this application you will need to download all of your team names and schedules into the app, once completed, parents can create an account that will show team(s) they are associated with and their game day rosters will show on the in-app calendar.

* Once the schedule is added parents can pick a game day and it should take you to a new page. This page will tell you the time of the game, what team you are playing against, home vs away status, field name/number, and will have options to sign up for snack that day. 

* Parents can click on an option from each category (snacks & beverages) and then click the submit button to add this selection to the calendar. 

* There is additionally a delete button that can be utilized if a parent wants to change what they are bringing for snack or to remove themselves as the designated snack provider for that game date.
