Sports Teams App
We decided to create this app as a way to organize a childs snack schedule for game day. Eveyone needs a snack after playing hard. 

To use this application you will need to download all of your team names and schedules. Once that is done you will have the parents create an account and pick they team/teams they are associated with. Once you have your selected team the game roster will be added to the calendar attached to the app. 

Once the schedule is added you can pick a game day and it should take you to a new page. This page will tell you the time of the game, what team you are playing against, home vs away status, field name/number, and an options to sign up for snack that day. 

Click on the snack option and you will be able to choose what type of snack you are bring to the game that day. 

We have used the following technology to create this app: 
React
Express
Node
Heroku
PGAdmin
Github 
VSCode
